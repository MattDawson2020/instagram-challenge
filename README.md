Instagram Challenge
===================

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

[See this app run live at Heroku](https://still-fortress-76749.herokuapp.com/)

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a User
So that I can show others my pictures 
I want to post a Jam to InstaJam

As a User
So that I can see other's pictures
I want to see all Jams most recent first

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a User
So that I can identify my own pictures
I want to sign up for InstaJam

HARDER

As a User
So that only I can post Jams as me
I want to log in to InstaJam

As a User
So that I can avoid others posting messages on InstaJam
I want to log out of Instajam

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that people can see a demonstration of my app
I want to host it on Heroku
```

Setup:
-------

* Clone this repo, run bundle migrate to install any dependencies, run rails db:migrate to install your tables
* Use < rails s /server > command in terminal to launch Rails server, and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to interact with the app
* Alternatively use < rackup > and go to localhost:9292
* Why not make it even easier for yourself and just click the Heroku link at the top?



Successes
-----
* Challenge requirements managed without much issue or blockers
* Successfully used active storage, rails generators and other more advanced features for the first time
* Was able to push to heroku without much issue

------------------

To improve
-----
* Left bootstrap and styling till the end, and while attempting to set it up encounted SEVERE git issues that ultimately required two hours to make the app work again, and meant I had to abandon styling and leave the project incomplete. I intend to come back and do it again after the course.
